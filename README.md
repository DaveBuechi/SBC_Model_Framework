# SBC Model Framework


## Introduction

This project is a lightweight and dynamic framework for the generation of SBC and micro-controller models written in OpenSCAD.

### Current SBC: 47 represented by 43 models.

Some SBC in SBC Model Framework have not been validated and may produce one or more aspects of the SBC incorrectly.


GREEN = verified to be correct using SBC Case Builder.

YELLOW = unverified, mostlikely usable and/or missing minor information.

ORANGE = unverified, may be usable but missing component data.

RED = unverified, not usable due to incomplete component data.



Hardkernel Odroid:

c1+,c2,c4,xu4,xu4q,mc1,hc1,hc4,m1,n1,n2,n2+,h2 - GREEN, verified.

show2 - ORANGE, unverified, unknown status.



Nividia:

jetsonnano - GREEN, verified.



Pine64:

All created from mechanical drawings except rockpro64 which was contributed. The SOC data is missing for many of these SBC.

rock64 - YELLOW, unverified mostlikely usable and/or missing minor information.

rockpro64 - YELLOW, unverified mostlikely usable and/or missing minor information.
